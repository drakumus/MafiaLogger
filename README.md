# MafiaLogger
This project is designed to assist the moderation of Mafia games. 

#Usage

Add Players manually by entering their name and game number in the two boxes at the top of the panel.
Otherwise see instructions bellow for enabling TS loading.

Go into Teamspeak and under:
Tools>Options>Chat
Check the box in this panel under "Automatic Logging" labled "Log channel chats"

Once this is done after asking for x's to log players as long as the player put an x in their chat their 
name will be logged and added/updated to the current players list (first large pair of boxes).

If a player fails to x up for a game they can either be manually retired using the retire button or the
Teamspeak Populate button will handle retiring the player to the retire list for you. 

The rest should be fairly striaght forward.

#Warning
Make sure you click on names to edit values not numbers.
Names cannot be edited. You must remove wrong names and create new ones with the desired number
